## üêõ Known Issues

1. **E2E Tests**: Not fully tested with real external APIs (Notion, Google Sheets)
   - Recommendation: Test your sync configurations carefully before relying on them

2. **Large Datasets**: Performance with >10,000 records not validated
   - Recommendation: Use smaller batches or consider manual sync for very large datasets

3. **CSV Periodic Sync**: Not supported yet (manual sync only for CSV)
   - Workaround: Use manual sync or switch to API-based sync for automation

4. **CORS Restrictions**: Some APIs may not work due to browser security
   - Workaround: Use APIs that properly support CORS headers

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Security Tips
1. **Choose a Strong Master Password**:
   - At least 12 characters
   - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
   - NOT something easy to guess

2. **Remember Your Password**:
   - Write it down and store it safely (NOT on your computer)
   - Consider using a password manager
   - There is NO password recovery

3. **Regular Backups**:
   - Export your data as CSV regularly
   - Store backups in multiple secure locations
   - Test restoring from backup occasionally

### Sync Best Practices
1. **Start with Manual Sync**:
   - Test your configuration with manual sync first
   - Switch to periodic sync only after verifying it works

2. **Test Connection Before Saving**:
   - Always use the "Test Connection" button
   - Fix any errors before enabling sync

3. **Handle Conflicts Wisely**:
   - "Latest Timestamp": Best for collaborative editing
   - "Local Priority": Best when local data is more important
   - "Remote Priority": Best when external source is source of truth

4. **Monitor Sync History**:
   - Check the History tab regularly
   - Clean up old history to save storage space
   - Investigate any failed syncs

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "I forgot my master password!"
**Solution**: Unfortunately, there is no password recovery. You'll need to:
1. Uninstall the extension
2. Reinstall it (this will erase all encrypted data)
3. Import your data from CSV backups (if you have them)
4. Create a new master password

### "Data migration failed!"
**Solution**:
1. Check Chrome console for error messages
2. Try the rollback option in System Settings
3. If rollback fails, reinstall and import from CSV backup

### "Sync is not working!"
**Troubleshooting steps**:
1. Click "Test Connection" - does it succeed?
2. Check your API key/credentials are correct
3. Verify the API endpoint URL is correct
4. Check sync history for error messages
5. Ensure your internet connection is stable

### "The 'Ë®≠ÂÆö' button doesn't work!"
**Solution**: This is fixed in version 2.5.0! Make sure you've upgraded.

### "Form fields are missing!"
**Solution**: The form structure changed in 2.5.0. Old configurations need to be recreated with the new inputs/outputs structure.
